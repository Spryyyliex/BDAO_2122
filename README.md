# BDAO
Big Data, Analytics & Optimisation (BDAO) 2021-2022

# Description
Work for students enrolled in the BDAO 21-22 module on the e-BM course.

This code it to get you going in using Python for BDAO. It hopefully gives you an understanding of what is possible and you don't always need to subscribe to expensive SEO tools to get and analyse data.

There are many more tutorials out there. They tend to be more advanced than the ones here so please have a look and try some that suit your current level.
